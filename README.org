#+title: Personal Emacs Configuration

A modern, literate Emacs configuration using =org-mode= and =straight.el= for package management. This configuration emphasizes Python development, org-mode productivity, and a clean, efficient interface.

Inspired by the excellent [[https://systemcrafters.net/emacs-from-scratch/basics-of-emacs-configuration/][The Basics of Emacs Configuration]] from System Crafters.

* Features

- *Literate Configuration*: Written in org-mode, the configuration self-documents and tangles to =init.el=
- *Modern Package Management*: Uses =straight.el= with =use-package= for reproducible package installation
- *Development Tools*:
  - Python development environment with LSP support via =pylsp=
  - Tree-sitter integration for better syntax handling
  - Git integration with Magit and git-gutter
  - YAML mode for configuration files
- *Enhanced Interface*:
  - Doom themes and modeline for a modern look
  - Ivy/Counsel for completion
  - Which-key for command discovery
  - Helpful for better help buffers
- *Org-mode Configuration*:
  - Custom capture templates for various content types
  - Structured task management with custom TODO states
  - Calendar integration with org-agenda
  - Beautiful typography with mixed-pitch mode
- *MacOS Support*:
  - Custom key bindings for MacOS compatibility
  - High DPI display optimizations
  - MacOS-specific font configuration

* Installation

1. Back up your existing =.emacs.d= if you have one:
   #+begin_src bash
   mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.backup
   #+end_src

2. Clone this repository:
   #+begin_src bash
   git clone https://github.com/rmorison/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
   #+end_src

3. Create symbolic links:
   #+begin_src bash
   mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d
   ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.emacs.d/Emacs.org ~/.emacs.d/
   ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.emacs.d/init.el ~/.emacs.d/
   ln -s ~/.dotfiles/org ~/org
   #+end_src

4. Start Emacs - =straight.el= will automatically install all packages. The configuration will automatically tangle =Emacs.org= to =init.el= whenever you save changes to =Emacs.org=.

** MacOS-Specific Setup

1. Install required packages via Homebrew:
   #+begin_src bash
   brew install svn
   brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
   brew install --cask font-fira-code font-fira-mono
   brew install --cask font-cantarell
   brew install coreutils
   #+end_src

2. Configure keyboard modifiers in System Settings:
   - Caps Lock Key → Control
   - Control Key → Option
   - Option Key → Command
   - Command Key → Command

The configuration includes MacOS-specific overrides that:
- Adjust font sizes for Retina/high DPI displays
- Map modifier keys for a more ergonomic experience
- Use GNU ls (gls) for dired mode compatibility

* Structure

#+begin_src

│   └── init.el      # Generated configuration

#+end_src

* Dependencies

- Emacs 29+ (for native tree-sitter support)
- Python 3.12+ (for Python development features)
- Git
- [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][Fira Code]] and [[https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cantarell][Cantarell]] fonts
- Node.js (for Mermaid diagrams)

** Optional Dependencies

- pyenv or similar for Python virtual environment management
- [[https://www.nerdfonts.com/][nerd-fonts]] for icons

* Customization

The configuration is primarily controlled through =Emacs.org=. This file is organized into logical sections with detailed comments explaining each configuration choice. When you save changes to =~/.dotfiles/.emacs.d/Emacs.org=, it will automatically tangle to =init.el=. You'll need to restart Emacs or evaluate the changed sections to apply the updates.
